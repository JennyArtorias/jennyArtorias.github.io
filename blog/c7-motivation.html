      <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
      <li>
            <ul>Pleasure: This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star type of happiness beause it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.</ul>
            <ul>Passion: Also known as "flow," where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.</ul>
            <ul>Higher Purpose: This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.</ul>
            
            <p>Happiness arising from higher purpose, in contrast, is highly sustainable. Common is opposite.</p>

      <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>What are your core values?</h3>
      <p>Responsibility </p>
      <p>Close to perfect</p>
      <h3>What do you stand for?</h3>
      <p>Im not exactly sure... need to think more on this</p>
      <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
      <p>Whichever emotion i may show on the outside there is a a usual likely hood i will have considered the opposite on the inside. Pessimism vs optimism i usaully  try to balance between the two on default. Objectivity and neutrality i definately enjoy... from my point of view. i guess lol. </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>Motivation is proberly a concept i play around with in my mind alot because im pretty lazy by default.. It was interesting to see an explanation for pleasure passion and purpose and a explained positive cycle for it.</p>
