          <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
          <p>Mindfulness training and techniques develop our analytical awareness to complement our subjective self awareness to compelete this wisdom.</p>
          
          <p>Self awareness gives us an understanding of what we are doing, our strengths and weaknesses, of our likes and dislikes, of our own personality, of our emotions it is subjective. </p>
          
          <p>Mindfulness gives us realisation and recall. it is a form of awareness, but is analytical giving us observations without judgement. It is objective.</p>
          
          <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it?How did you feel?</h3>
          <p>Body Scan</p>
          
          <p>I have to admit it felt a bit silly focusing on different parts of my body xD making it difficult to focus.</p>
          <p>Journaling</p>
          <p>My experience journaling made me feel a bit uncomfortable with myself. I found listing my strengths difficult as i am a bit averse to self praise. While i found my self with a very long list of weaknesses. I noted that i seem to have alot of simple pleasures and found it difficult to list annoyances.</p>
          
          <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h3>
          <p>That we are all human xD. Feelings are natural and how we react and respond to them is what counts :).</p>
