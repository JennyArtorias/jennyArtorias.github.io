  	<h3>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
  		<p>HTMl is used to semantically structure the website(barebones, blueprints). CSS is used to decorate the website(Like painting a house).
  		Javascript is used to rearrange/add furniture pieces or add accessories to said house</p>

  	<h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example "waking up" or "brushing your teeth"</h3>
  		<p>Control flow are conditional statements within code that allow the for branching off and decision making. Example of conditional statements are if, if else, while, do while, switch. An everyday analogy would be present in everyday real life decision making. E.g "If" it is raining bring a rain coat(condition true) else do not(decision to be executed if condition is false).</p>
  
  	<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h3>
  		<p>A javascript object is a basic data structure. Everything in javascript is an object. Javascript arrays are a type of object used for storing mulitple values in a single variable. Each value gets numeric index and may be any data type. Difference is Object use strings while arrays use numbers.</p>
  
  	<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
  		<p>There are programs that requrie a lot of generality, and programs that need to use the same piece of code again and aagin, which usually means some code should be seperated from the main program so it can be called on repeatedly.
  		</p>

  		<p>In computer jargon, we need flexibility, modularity and re-usability. Implementing these concepts in a computer language involves constructs that are not completely necessary, but do save a lot of time and effort.</p>
  
  		<p>The most basic purpose of a function is to contain code. A function's advanced features are that it can take parameters and return values.</p>
