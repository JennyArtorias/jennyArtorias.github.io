      <h3>Have you tried any of the insights and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go ?</h3>
      
      <p>I feel because i have social anxiety that can get pretty severe self awareness alot of the time is just there :/. I do love to entertain thoughts without accepting and do so quite often. Kinda makes me happy on the inside ^_^ </p>
      
      <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
      
      <p>What i hear you say is -> What i hear you feel</p>
      <p>I believe i inadvertently get many chances at empathic listening due to a list of friends that confide with me often on there relationship problems. Now when i get confided in empathic listening notion comes to mind making me self aware at that point. Makes me less inclined to make a jk and i will make a self aware effort to understand how they feel.  </p>
      
      <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
      
      <p>Visualing someone i care about and going through a script in my mind i guess made me feel a bit guilty :( even though your on the end of transmitting kindness. A sort of strange feeling when you muse about selfawareness. 4th wall meta. It was a very calming experience though.</p>
    
      <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</h3>
      
      <p>Selecting a teams among friends in a MOBA game. The argument/disagrement would be on fairness of teams</p>
      
      <p>I guess its worth noting everyone is trying to win.</p>
      <p>I will experience happiness winning but i prefer an even game that could flip flop either way</p>
      <p>I find this exercise difficult in that ive usually always seperated my emotions and logic by default and i believe its ingrained in my personality to a degree to which i sometimes dislike or feel uncomfortable with myself.</p>
      
      <p>Describing the game as though im 100 percent correct and reasonable... i believe from past experience i would suggest a few ways of solving this problem. Select the teams in the most random unpredictable way as possible. No team picking influence to anyone. That way there would be no arguement later about picking not talked skill difference among players. The problem with that kind of team picking is that the teams would proberly end up unfair therefore the game onesided (boring for me) fun for 1 party and disheartning for the other. There would be Raging during the game and proberly toxic behaviour.</p>
      
      <p>The other option is pick out team leaders then pick teams. This usually means player skills are bought up which leads to egos being bruised and feelings being hurt.</p>
      
      <p>Describing the game as though the other people are 100 percent correct and reasonable. Technically usually when this conflict arises there is not much thought given into fairness as so much as pick team asap so we can start the a game. There is also rivarlies and egos that have gone uncheck for soo long lol... that trying to bring up fairness and equal and balanced teams brings up the conversation of skill level. Ego's usually run amok at this point and there is usually self worth inflation. At least there is a lack of Newbie* deadweight finger pointing compartively but its still there. The outcome due to team stacking or lack of fairness usually results in a altercation with varying levels of toxicity relative to "how badly did you lose". </p>
      
      <p>notes needs to rewrite</p>
      
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      
      <p>LOL psychologizing or agreeing.... T.T</p>
      <p>I think im quite efficient at seperating feelings and logic and have a habit of doing such things on a daily basis to the point where it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes</p>
      
      <p>I think its worth noting that ive been called a robot more than a few people </p>
      <p>I like how the book is relatable if that makes sense</p>
