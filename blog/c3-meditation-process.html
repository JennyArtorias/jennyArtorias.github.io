  	    <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
  		<p>Process over product made the assignment a bit more stress free i think. It allowed to treat the website like a sandbox where you can build, test, try repeart process.</p>
        <h3>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
  		<p>In a very cliche way i thought meditation was just focusing and getting lost in one thoughts. Along with pseudo day dreaming.</p>
        <h3>What new things have you learnt about mediation</h3>
  		<p>That one should consider intention. Creating an intention is itself a form of meditation. Everytime you create an intention, you are subtly forming or reinforcing a mental habit. If you create the same intention a lot, it eventually becomes a habit that will keep arising in your mind in varied situations to guide your behaviour. </p>
        <h3>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
  		<p>Musing over intentions and literally following breathing patterns.</p>
        <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
  		<p>I think without being aware of it i mediatate alot.</p>
