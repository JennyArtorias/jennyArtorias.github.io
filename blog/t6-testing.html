      <h3>What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.</h3>

            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Javascript has two scopes - Global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each funciton has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.</p></ul>
        <ul>
            <h4>Pseudo def</h4>
            <p>Basically inside function variables can only be used inside that function. Variables declared on are on load</p>
          
            <p>If you don't declare variables with the var keyword, they are part of the global scope</p>
            
            <p>Always declare variables within a function with var keyword</p>
          </ul>
