        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h2>
      
      <h3>Psuedocode</h3>
      <p>Pseudo code helped my thinking process alot. Allows to fall back on simple instructions logic. Using real life decision making scenarios connecting them to decision making statements.</p>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>I love the rubber duck method because i believe i do that with most things anyway xD. I do whisper to myself outloud proberly crazy :/</p>

      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>Reading error messages was very useful for me as syntax errors are less common i think on a specific keyboard for me. While disproportionaly more common when im using my laptop.</p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>I do like console logging as you can see the result of your function straight away. However typing out the code directly on the console felt a little different and is a bit harder due habits having to be altered a bit for the process. </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>Google is my friend in everyway shape and form :). Can dive deeper into aspects/concepts and if REALLY time wasting stuck switch subjects or try to look for a direct solution. Which would lead to trying to deciphering the solution and trying the problem again.</p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>I suck at asking for help even though i really should. Proberly an over reliance on google when stuck. Though i will ask if im Truely stuck and hit the brickwall multiple times.</p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>If being honest prefer asking coaches over peers simply because im more likely to get a quicker direct answer but once again will only do so when truely stuck and brickwall multiple times.</p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>In terms of improving my process with reflection i believe i do have some reflection habits coming in. Playing 
		teamwork/strategy oriented games seriously does invoke alot of reflection on why you suck unfortunately.</p>

      
      
      <h3>Using the JS array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h3>
      
      <h3>.map()</h3>

		<p>The map function allows us to takes values in an array and transform each of those values into another one.</p>

		<p>Shorthanded way of for eaching each value indivdually</p>

		<p>more concise code</p>

		<h3>.filter()</h3>  

		<p>The filter method returns elements that match a certain criteria. This method lets you specify criteria and nonmatches are removed.</p>

		<p>Basically like a water filter. code(water) comes in filter(filter function) filters out dirt (Element criteria that do not match.)</p>

		<h3>.reduce()</h3> FJDSKLFJSDKLFJSDFKJSDJ

		<p>visual explanation</p>

		<p>var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</p>
		<p>array.reduce(function(a,b){return a + b})</p>
		<p>28</p>
		<p>array[0] + array[1] --> the numbers crunched become archon.</p>
		<p>1st time: a = 1, b = 2 (1 + 2=3)</p>
		<p>2nd time: a = 3, b = 3 (3 + 3=6)</p>
		<p>3rd time: a = 6, b = 4 (6 + 4=10)</p>
		<p>4th time: a = 10, b = 5 (10 + 5=15)</p>
		<p>5th time: a = 15, b = 6 (15 + 6 = 21)</p>
		<p>6th time: a = 21, b = 7 (21 + 7 = 28)</p>

		<h3>Recursion compares to iteration</h3>

		<p>Style of looping comes down to which is faster or which is easier to maintain.</p>

		<p>Recursion: See my previous remark about "recursion". For more information you can also check out "recursion".</p>

		<p>Iteration: After reading this word aloud, in between counting from 0 to 1000, you should be able to understand what this means.</p>

		<p>A recursive function works through the process of calling itself until a condition is met. Iteration uses a looping control structure (while, do while, for) to repeat a section of code until a condition is met.</p>
