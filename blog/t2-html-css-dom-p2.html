      <div><h3>Reasons for Semantic structure</h3>

        <li>
          <ul>Clean -> It’s easier to read and edit, which saves time and money during maintenance.</ul>
          <ul>More accessible ->It can be better understood by a greater variety of devices. Those devices can then add their own style and presentation based on what’s best for the device.</ul>
          <ul>Search engine friendly -> This is still debatable as search engines rank content and not code, but search engines are making greater use of things like microformats to understand content.</ul>
        </li>
