  	<h3>What did you learn from your "mindfulness conversation"? How did the other person find it?</h3>
  		<p>Being self aware and trying to bring back focus and attention(reminder). I think appreciation...</p>

  	<h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
  		<p>I zone out very easily and very quickly when im bored. I also half tune out and tend  to half daydream on the spot lol T.T. Making a mental effort on my wandering. Reading this chpater on mindfulness.. i think i may already employ some nudging to bring back wandering attention over and over again.</p>

  	<h3>Any other musing</h3>
  		<p>Anwser above i think xD. Mainly zoning out or half tuning. Perhaps trying to absorb enough to respond.</p>
