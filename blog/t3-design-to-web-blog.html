  <div>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</div>
      <p>Most websites in the past have been developed based on fixed layouts. Responsive design, is an approach that web designers and developers take to adapt the layout of a site to enable small and large screen devices to share the same code base and content without the need of seperate website properties. Through responsive design you only need to develop one codebas for all your users, no matter what device they use.</p>
      
<div>What a mobile first design is, and why it's important</div>
      <p>Mobile first design is conceptually starting with displaing the website on mobile devices rather than a desktop. Which leads to quite a different approach on how to deal with content. It is important because "content hierachy" becomes important. E.g most important piece on top followed by next and next.</p>
      
<div>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</div>
      <p>The definition of framework is a basic structure underlying a system concept or text. In this case web design. They provide structure and tools that have been predefined to get you focussed on the layout and content of the site rather than the CSS and HTML (although these are very important also) </p>
      
<div>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</div>
      <p> Absolute position fixed inline. Even using developer tools its not always easy to predict where a element ends up. This applies especially when trying to css everything from scratch and with absolutely no guide. Which is usually the case for self testing on whether i actually understand concepts or not. Usually rectified with google.</p>
