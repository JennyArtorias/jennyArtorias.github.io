        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>Whenever i attempt mindfulness meditation i focus on my breathing and end up day dreaming xD.It allows me to briefly reflect upon my actions conemplations, emotions and productivity during the week in an honest manner. Laying out pros and cons. Its smiliar to when i drift off sometimes and focal point on lingering feelings or thoughts situations and scenarios x).</p>
