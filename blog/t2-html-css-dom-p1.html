  	<div><h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS,and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
  			<p>HTML is a language, which makes it possible to present information (e.g. scientific research) on the Internet. What you see when you view a page on the Internet is your browser's interpretation of HTML. HTML is used to semantically organise your site layout. Analogy -> House blueprints </p>

  			<p>CSS is a language used to decorate your site -> Analogy would be house style decorations.</p>

  			<p>DOM is a logical model that can be implemented in any convenient manner.It is based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. </p>

  	<div><h3>What is meant by boxifying a design</h3>
  		<p> Boxifying a design is looking at the design of a website and
  		seperating identifiable elements into "boxes" that can be rearranged on a grid layout.</p>


  	</div>
  	<div><h3>What is a box model</h3>

  		<p>Every element on the page has a "Box" around it. I.e Margin, borders, padding.
  		This is the box model. </p>
